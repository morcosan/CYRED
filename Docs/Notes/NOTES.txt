	> Application



test project from standalone



2 ways to start application
- Run( GameController ) 			// when u want full project in C++
- Run( string configFilePath )  	// when u used scene file
 


GameController::Start() must build the scene



Resources:
- images, sounds, models will have .meta files with same name that contains details

- editor
	- editor configFile
		- path to assets folder
	- project file
		- path to assets folder
	- the assets folder will be fully parsed

- standalone 
	1) full c++, no external files
		- started with GameController
		- no config file needed
		- the assets can be anywhere
		- the FileSystem will be able to load on demand by path
	2) with external files
		- started with config file
		- config files contains paths to other resource files
