General rules:
- the code must be easily to read by anyone
- a data structure must be self-contained (one must be able to understand it without needing to read the others)
- each function needs a comment describing why the function exists and where should be used
- add wrapper for every external code



C++ Only:
- pre-declare classes needed in *.h, but include the files only in *.cpp
- keep comments for function's importance in *.h
- in *.h, first declare the inherited functions, then the standalone ones
- use a namespace instead of copying the same thing in each class name
- keep as mush as possible away from *.h


C++ Macros:
#define OUT
